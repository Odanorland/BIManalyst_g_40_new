# About the tool 

## State the problem / claim that your tool is solving.
### Quickly determine quantity and cost of elements (ex.doors) in a model 
## State where you found that problem.

### In our experience with the 'Advanced Building Design' course, we spent a significant amount of time extracting quantities for tasks like cost calculations and LCA analysis. A tool to streamline this process would be very useful.  
### The tool first identifies the number of doors in the IFC model. Then, it calculates the total cost for each door type based on user-input. Finally, a table displaying each door type, unit price, and total cost is generated, making the data clear and easy for the user to interpret.  

## instructions to run the tool.
### Open the script in visual studio code or similar, and view the terminal.  The terminal shows "PS" and the location, and then you should type "python" and you filename (ex.01Script.py).  Run the script from the terminal.  Give the input that the program asks for. The first thing the program will ask for is the file path. Insert then the file path to where the model is stored on your computer. (It could for example look like this: C:\Users\xxxxx\Documents\DTU\41934 Advanced BIM\A3\CES_BLD_24_11_ARC.ifc). You should get the data presented in a table.
