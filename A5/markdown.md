# A5: Reflection

## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
*  **Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:** The level in the begining was, indeed, beginning, the group didn't know much about coding or OpenBIM. Our experience with BIM was more on the actual modelling (in ex. revit) rather than handling the data. The course definitely gave a good insight in the many oppetunities BIM gives, but we feel like we would need some more skills within coding to actually develop useful scripts/tools talked about in the course. With that said, the excercises was a good way of practising this.     ~~On the other hand, trough the entire course we were able to understand how this new "world" works. The feeling shared in the group is that we were able to learn so much in every single exercise that we get to the end very satisfied with our improvements, even though we still see many improvements opportunities.~~
  
*  **What else do you still need to learn?** During the middle of the whole course, we were struggling a lot with the use of Open Cascade, to the point that we had to give up using it, change the project focus and move on. Would be nice for the future to learn more about how to properly use this tool. Also, as mentioned above, more coding skills would be necessary to make the tools as we want. 

*  **How you might use OpenBIM in the future?** OpenBIM provides many possible opportunities, however, being the focus of the group Building, it's more likely that our main use would be related to quantities take off used for cost/project sceduling/LCA assessment etc. 
 
## Your process of developing the tutorial
* **Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?** I would say the course defined questions relavant for later for thesis but maybe not answering questions. The open-BIM still feels like a diffuse consept but is for sure something that is relevant for later.  ~~Yes, most of the course objectives were well explained, making it easier to understand, remenber and likely use in the future.~~

* **Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?** No, the number of use cases is good, and it addresses many good aspects and focus areas. 

* **Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?** Generally speaking it was ok, maybe there could be some very few changes but which would be very personal, so thinking as group, the tools provided were good and enough.

## (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
* **did the tool address the use case you identified?** 

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
* **are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?**
 Hugo: even that I find this topic extremly interesting and I see as a huge learning opportunity, I still haven't put much thought on my what will be my thesis about, so it's possible that it could used, but is not set in stone.

* **are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?**
 Hugo: as I see myself working in the industry in an area related to digitalisation, I think it's safe to say that yes, it's very likely that I would be working with these tools in my future professional life.
  

## (Individual) Wrap up
* **conclude the journey through A1-A5:**
Hugo: the journey was long but satisfatory, with a lot of struggle in the middle of the project, and sometimes the feeling that we would never be able to finish and deliver a nice result. But in the and, after a lot of going back and forth and reformulating the case, we were able to create a tool that provides important and accurate information regarding the model, meaning that we achieved our main goal.
