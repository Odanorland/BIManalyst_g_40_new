# Tool: Extracting amount of doors and determining cost

* Group 40 - Analyst 
* Focus area: Built
* Analyst Level 2: Analyse the property sets of an IFC file in the BlenderBIM GUI and develop a simple Python Script in BlenderBIM using ifcOpenShell.

## State the problem / claim that your tool is solving.
*  Quickly determine quantity and cost of elements (ex.doors) in a model 
## State where you found that problem.
* In our experience with the 'Advanced Building Design' course, we spent a significant amount of time extracting quantities for tasks like cost calculations and LCA analysis. A tool to streamline this process would be very useful.
