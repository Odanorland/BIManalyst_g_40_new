    A2a: About your group
    I am confident coding in Python: 
            1-Disagree
        What is your groupâ€™s focus area? 
            Built
        Is you focus area keeping the manager role? 
            Yes
        Are you an analyst or a manager?
            Analyst

    A2b: Identify Claim 
    We are working on building building 2411. 
         We want to identify the total cost of the glass facade. 
            By doing this we want to check quantities of glass facade and then add the cost to it. 

            This script could be useful in both the early and later stages of the design process. 
            Also we believe that with a script like this we could easily reuse it to find for example column and cost, or change it find columns and total volume, and then again use it for LCA                analyses and similar. 

    A2c: Use Case
           How you would check this fact?
               We will get the scipt to get the total area of glass facade from the model. We will then give the price as an imput. We will also try to see if we can make the script read the                     report and find the price itself, but this would be useless if we on another project have a model but not a report attached. 
           When would this claim need to be checked?
               This fact could be checked at an early stage because this is the time when it`s easiest to do changes. For example we check the total procing of the glass facade and figure out                 the type chosen is to ecxpensive so it should be changed for another one, or the area with fglass facade should be decreased. 
               It could also be used at any point of the project, depending on what it should be used for (LCA, process plan etc) . 
           What information does this claim rely on?
               The area of each glass wall, and then added together to get the total area. And then the chosen facade type, and the unit price (per m2) for this type. 
            What phase? planning, design, build or operation.
                The cost would mainly be relevant in the planning and design phase, to make desicions. But also during building phase to track budgets. Quantities in itself is relevant for all                 phases. For example build when making a schedule. 
            What BIM purpose is required? Gather, generate, analyse, communicate or realise
                Gather, because we are quantifying elements. 
            Review use case examples - do any of these help?, What BIM use case is this closest to? If you cannot find one from the examples, you can make a new one.
                02 Cost Estimation is similar to what we will be doing. 
            Produce a BPMN drawing for your chosen use case.
